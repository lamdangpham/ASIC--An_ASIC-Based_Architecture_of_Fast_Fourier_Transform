#ASIC-Based Architecture of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on 130nm Technology

Work for “Develop an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) digital hardware architecture applying Vietnam speech recognition automatically” project funded by Department Science and Technology of Ho Chi
Minh City, Vietnam.

We achieved a dynamic VLSI architecture of ANN, which can re-configure both multiple layers and multiply nodes per layer.
